# Terrain-Recognition-from-Time-Series-Data

We have implemented the baseline models for our experimental project of determining terrain from sensor data attached to  prosthetic limbs.
The three models that we have simulated are:
1. 1D CNN
2. Weighted Random Forest
3. Weighted SVM

### PS: To run Weighted Random Forest, create an empty folder called Experiments as all the experimental sampled data will be stored in that folder.
